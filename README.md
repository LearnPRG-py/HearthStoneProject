<h1>Project HearthStone</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the project </h2>
Approximately 70 million people in the world are deaf mutes, according to the World Health Organisation, which is a large prevailing issue due to communication issues with other people - this means they cannot hear anything in their surroundings or respond effectively to them. This can be dangerous, especially in emergencies,
Not to mention it may contribute to social ostracisation, because not everyone knows how to interpret sign language. To combat this, we want to create a device that will allow those who are deaf mutes to communicate with those who may not understand ASL, American Sign Language.

<h2>Features</h2>
- Real-time ASL recognition <br>
- Translation to text or speech <br>
- User-friendly interface for both deaf/mute and hearing individuals <br>
- Portable and accessible hardware design <br>
- Future integration with ISL as well. <br>
